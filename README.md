# Nashville-Housing-Data-for-Data-Cleaning

This project involves comprehensive data manipulation and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **SQL**. <br/>

I worked with Nashville Housing Data, a dataset containing statistics about landuse and properties in Nashville, the capital city of the U.S. state of Tennessee. <br/>

I used SQL in MySQL Workbench to explore and analyze data from this database.

### Dataset obtained from
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmthyjames/nashville-housing-data) , containing 56,478 records.

### Data Cleaning
Here are some data cleaning techniques used for Nashville housing data: <br/>
* Standardizing date formats
* Populating missing property addresses
* Splitting address components into separate columns for better granularity
* Transforming “Y” and “N” values into “Yes” and “No” for readability
* Using techniques such as self-join, substring, and partitioning
